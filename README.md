# UNO-game
Overview

This project is a C++ implementation of the popular card game UNO. The game includes the basic features of UNO, such as turn-based gameplay, card drawing, and action cards (like Reverse, Skip, and Draw Two). The objective of the game is for players to get rid of all their cards, and the first player to do so wins!

Game Rules

    Players take turns playing cards that match either the color or number of the top card in the discard pile.
    Action Cards include:
        Reverse: Changes the direction of play.
        Skip: Skips the next player's turn.
        Draw Two: The next player draws two cards and misses their turn.
        Wild Card: Allows the player to choose any color.
        Wild Draw Four: Forces the next player to draw four cards and allows the current player to choose the color.
    Gameplay continues until one player has no cards left.
    Scoring: If a player wins, points are tallied based on the cards left in the opponent's hand.
